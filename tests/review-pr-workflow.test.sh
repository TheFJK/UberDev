#!/usr/bin/env bash
# tests/review-pr-workflow.test.sh — #381: the /review-pr + /simplify wiring
# into skills/review-fleet/workflow.js.
#
# The engine shipped before anything could select it, and the whole point of
# this suite is that the two halves cannot drift apart again. Three surfaces:
#
#   S — the shell seam: lib/dispatch.sh must ADMIT the workflow backend for
#       review-pr/simplify (or the wiring is unreachable) while still refusing
#       every backend it refused before, and the no-provider-arm refusal must
#       survive.
#   G — per-stage shape greps over commands/review-pr.md and commands/simplify.md:
#       every stage owes the RFC 0012 §4.1 existence guard, the per-child mkdir,
#       the CSPRNG nonce mint, a binding minted BEFORE dispatch, the args
#       envelope, the mandated Workflow call, and the post-return capture verbs.
#       Plus the roster order, which is a wire format shared with the script.
#   B — BEHAVIORAL: the review-stage and lens-stage mint fences are EXTRACTED
#       FROM THE COMMAND FILES AND RUN, against the real
#       lib/code_fixer_contract.py. The envelope they print and the launched
#       ledger they write are then cross-checked against each other, so a
#       dropped nonce or a dropped emission is a hard failure rather than a
#       missing grep.
#
# Unix-only (python3 + realpath + the contract round-trip over mktemp -d paths);
# declared in the test.yml windows-skip-list. Runs on ubuntu and macOS.
#
# FIXTURE DISCIPLINE (RFC 0012 §4.4): no secret-shaped literals.
