# Comprehensive PR Review

Run a comprehensive pull request review using multiple specialized agents, each focusing on a different aspect of code quality.

**Review Aspects (optional):** "$ARGUMENTS"

`/uberdev:review-pr` is a true **two-phase** command. Both phases run by default — flow: **review fanout → fix loop → simplify fanout → final aggregation**.

- **Phase 1 — Review + Fix loop**: parallel review fanout, then auto-apply fixes for the findings.
- **Phase 2 — Simplify pass**: parallel fanout of the three simplify lenses (reuse / quality / efficiency) defined in `/uberdev:simplify`, with auto-applied edits committed separately. Single-message dispatch per the `uberdev:post-impl-review` contract.

Pass `--no-simplify` (anywhere in the arguments) to skip Phase 2 and preserve the legacy single-pass behavior. Cost trade-off: Phase 2 adds three extra agent invocations per run; opt out for fast feedback loops on iterative review (e.g. when you've already run `/uberdev:simplify` separately).

## Review Workflow:

1. **Determine Review Scope**
   - Check git status to identify changed files
   - Parse arguments to see if user requested specific review aspects
   - Detect `--no-simplify` token in `$ARGUMENTS` and strip it from the aspect list — sets `SIMPLIFY_PHASE=0`, otherwise `SIMPLIFY_PHASE=1` (default)
   - Default: Run all applicable reviews + Phase 2 simplify pass

2. **Available Review Aspects:**

   - **comments** - Analyze code comment accuracy and maintainability
   - **tests** - Review test coverage quality and completeness
   - **errors** - Check error handling for silent failures
   - **types** - Analyze type design and invariants (if new types added)
   - **code** - General code review for project guidelines
   - **simplify** - Simplify code for clarity and maintainability
   - **all** - Run all applicable reviews (default)

3. **Identify Changed Files**
   - Run `git diff --name-only` to see modified files
   - Check if PR already exists: `gh pr view`
   - Identify file types and what reviews apply

4. **Determine Applicable Reviews**

   Based on changes:
   - **Always applicable**: uberdev:code-reviewer (general quality)
   - **If test files changed**: uberdev:pr-test-analyzer
   - **If comments/docs added**: uberdev:comment-analyzer
   - **If error handling changed**: uberdev:silent-failure-hunter
   - **If types added/modified**: uberdev:type-design-analyzer
   - **After passing review**: uberdev:code-simplifier (polish and refine)

5. **Launch Review Agents — parallel by default**

   **Dispatch all applicable agents concurrently in a single message** (one assistant turn, multiple Task tool_use blocks). Each agent sees the full diff and produces an independent report — they do not share state, so there is no reason to serialize them.

   This is a deliberate divergence from upstream `pr-review-toolkit`, which defaults to sequential. Parallel matches the orchestrator-first principle and the canonical fanout pattern used by `/uberdev:simplify`.

   **Sequential fallback** (only when explicitly requested via `sequential` argument):
   - Useful for interactive walkthroughs where you want to act on each report before the next
   - Otherwise, prefer parallel — wall-time scales with the slowest reviewer, not the sum

6. **Apply Phase 1 Fixes**

   Auto-apply the review fixes from the agent findings as one or more `fix:` / `refactor:` conventional commits. These are the **review-phase commits** — keep them distinct from the Phase 2 simplify commit (separate-commit invariant below).

7. **Phase 2 — Mandatory Simplify Pass** (skip iff `SIMPLIFY_PHASE=0`)

   After Phase 1 fixes land, dispatch the three simplify lenses (**Code Reuse Review**, **Code Quality Review**, **Code Efficiency Review**) as a parallel fanout — **all three Task() calls in a SINGLE assistant message, ONE assistant turn**, mirroring the `uberdev:post-impl-review` single-message dispatch contract. The lens-by-lens checklist (what each agent looks for) is the canonical definition in `/uberdev:simplify` Phase 2 — refer there rather than restate.

   **Brief preparation** (mirrors `uberdev:post-impl-review` Step 1):

   - Compute the post-Phase-1 diff once via `git diff <base>..HEAD` and pass the same brief verbatim to all three Task() calls.
   - Truncation rule: if the diff exceeds 2000 lines, summarise per-file (path + 1-line summary) and inline only the files where per-line scrutiny matters for that lens. Same rule as `uberdev:post-impl-review` SKILL Step 1.

   Each lens preserves the iron rule from `/uberdev:simplify`: **behavior preservation is non-negotiable.**

   **Auto-apply simplify edits** in a separate `refactor:` conventional commit, distinct from the Phase 1 review-fix commits. Reviewers must be able to tell "review fixes" apart from "simplify pass" by commit boundary alone — this distinct commit boundary is mandatory, not stylistic.

   **Advisory-only findings** (where a lens declines to edit because the change carries behavior risk, or the agent flags a concern outside the iron-rule envelope) are **never silently dropped** — they surface in the Phase 2 row of the final aggregation table (step 8) so the human reviewer sees them.

   **Non-blocking**: if the simplify-phase fanout itself fails (timeout, agent error, parse failure), `/review-pr` still exits successfully and reports the Phase 2 row's Status as `blocked` in the final aggregation (lowercase, matching the Status enum in step 9). Phase 1 review-fix work is **not undone**, and the command continues regardless of Phase 2 verdicts.

8. **Final Aggregation — distinguish review-phase vs simplify-phase findings**

   After Phase 1 fixes land and (if enabled) Phase 2 simplify edits land, summarize both phases in a single table that **distinguishes review-phase findings from simplify-phase findings**:

   - **Critical Issues** (must fix before merge)
   - **Important Issues** (should fix)
   - **Suggestions** (nice to have)
   - **Positive Observations** (what's good)

9. **Provide Action Plan**

   Organize findings, with the review-phase vs simplify-phase distinction preserved in every row:

   ```markdown
   # PR Review Summary

   ## Phase outcomes
   | Phase | Status | Verdict | Auto-applied | Advisory findings |
   |---|---|---|---|---|
   | Phase 1 — Review + Fix | ran | APPROVE / REVISIONS_REQUIRED / REJECT | <commit shas> | <count> |
   | Phase 2 — Simplify     | ran / blocked / skipped | APPROVE / REVISIONS_REQUIRED / REJECT (omit if status≠ran) | <commit sha or ∅> | <count> |

   `Verdict` reuses the canonical `uberdev:post-impl-review` reviewer enum (APPROVE | REVISIONS_REQUIRED | REJECT). `Status` is orthogonal: `ran` (the fanout completed), `blocked` (fanout failure — see "Non-blocking" above), `skipped` (`--no-simplify` was set).

   ## Critical Issues (X found)
   - [phase: review | simplify] [agent-name]: Issue description [file:line]

   ## Important Issues (X found)
   - [phase: review | simplify] [agent-name]: Issue description [file:line]

   ## Suggestions (X found)
   - [phase: review | simplify] [agent-name]: Suggestion [file:line]

   ## Strengths
   - What's well-done in this PR

   ## Recommended Action
   1. Fix critical issues first
   2. Address important issues
   3. Consider suggestions
   4. Re-run review after fixes
   ```

## Usage Examples:

**Full review (default):**
```
/uberdev:review-pr
```

**Specific aspects:**
```
/uberdev:review-pr tests errors
# Reviews only test coverage and error handling

/uberdev:review-pr comments
# Reviews only code comments

/uberdev:review-pr simplify
# Simplifies code after passing review
```

**Sequential override** (default is parallel):
```
/uberdev:review-pr all sequential
# Force one-at-a-time dispatch — use only for interactive walkthroughs
```

**Skip Phase 2 simplify pass** (legacy single-pass behavior):
```
/uberdev:review-pr --no-simplify
# Run only Phase 1 review-and-fix; skip the mandatory simplify fanout.
# Use when only correctness review is wanted (e.g. pre-merge gate after a
# /simplify pass already ran). Combinable with aspect args:
/uberdev:review-pr tests errors --no-simplify
```

## Agent Descriptions:

**uberdev:comment-analyzer**:
- Verifies comment accuracy vs code
- Identifies comment rot
- Checks documentation completeness

**uberdev:pr-test-analyzer**:
- Reviews behavioral test coverage
- Identifies critical gaps
- Evaluates test quality

**uberdev:silent-failure-hunter**:
- Finds silent failures
- Reviews catch blocks
- Checks error logging

**uberdev:type-design-analyzer**:
- Analyzes type encapsulation
- Reviews invariant expression
- Rates type design quality

**uberdev:code-reviewer**:
- Checks CLAUDE.md compliance
- Detects bugs and issues
- Reviews general code quality

**uberdev:code-simplifier**:
- Simplifies complex code
- Improves clarity and readability

## Tips:

- **Run early**: Before creating PR, not after
- **Focus on changes**: Agents analyze git diff by default
- **Address critical first**: Fix high-priority issues before lower priority
- **Re-run after fixes**: Verify issues are resolved
- **Use specific reviews**: Target specific aspects when you know the concern

## Workflow Integration:

**Before committing:**
```
1. Write code
2. Run: /uberdev:review-pr code errors
3. Fix any critical issues
4. Commit
```

**Before creating PR:**
```
1. Stage all changes
2. Run: /uberdev:review-pr all
3. Address all critical and important issues
4. Run specific reviews again to verify
5. Create PR
```

**After PR feedback:**
```
1. Make requested changes
2. Run targeted reviews based on feedback
3. Verify issues are resolved
4. Push updates
```

## Notes:

- Agents run autonomously and return detailed reports
- Each agent focuses on its specialty for deep analysis
- Results are actionable with specific file:line references
- Agents use appropriate models for their complexity
- All agents available in `/agents` list
